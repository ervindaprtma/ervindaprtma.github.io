        <h1>My Professional Journey</h1>

        <p>My name is Ervinda Pratama, commonly known as Ervinda. I graduated from SMK Negeri 1 Nglegok, a vocational high school in Blitar, specializing in Computer Network Engineering in 2018.</p>

        <p>After completing my studies, I began my career at PT. Universal Broadband, where I gained practical knowledge not covered in school. My responsibilities included network installation projects in various settings buildings, offices, residential areas, and factories. I also handled tasks such as repairing network connections, addressing server issues in data centers, and managing CCTV installation projects based on customer requests. Additionally, I served as Customer Service in the absence of field assignments.</p>

        <p>Towards the end of 2018, I transitioned to a startup in the Internet Service Provider sector, namely PT. Appnet Indonesia. In this role, I applied my previous experiences and took on significant projects. Assigned as the sole Network Engineer, I was responsible for building network systems from scratch. Over the years, I witnessed substantial growth, contributing to the expansion of the customer base from around 30 to 500, particularly in the Lamongan area.</p>

        <p>In mid-2023, around mid-April, I received an opportunity to work as a Network Center Operator at a startup called Ayesha Net. Interestingly, back in 2021 during my stay in Lamongan, I worked as a freelancer, handling network configuration, setup, and maintenance for various locations, including homes, RT/RW Net, offices, and schools. Ayesha Net was one of my clients. The owner later offered me a permanent remote position, appreciating the contributions I made during my freelance work for approximately 1-2 years. This collaboration helped Ayesha Net establish its network, starting from scratch and growing to over 300 customers by 2023, especially in the Kec. Kedungpring, Lamongan area.</p>
