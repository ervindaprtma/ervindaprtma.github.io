        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ervinda Pratama. Usually called Ervinda. I am a graduate of a vocational high school (SMK) from one of the vocational schools in Blitar, namely SMK Negeri 1 Nglegok, specializing in Computer Network Engineering in 2018.
            After graduating in 2018, I immediately worked at PT. Universal Broadband because before graduation I was accepted to work at that company. There I learned many things that had never been taught at school. Network installation projects in buildings, offices, residential areas and even in factories. Repair network connections and fix server problems in the data center/customer's local area. As well as good CCTV installation projects at every request from customers. I also act as Customer Service when there is no request to go to the field.
            At the end of 2018, I decided to move to a start-up in the Internet Service Provider sector, namely PT. Appnet Indonesia. There I started to practice some of the things I learned from the previous company and also received a truly large-scale project because I was assigned as the only Network Engineer and started building network systems to servers from the beginning until now (2023). Previously, when I first joined the company, it only had approximately 30 customers and now it has reached 500 customers, especially in the Lamongan area.
            In the middle of 2023, mid-April, I received a request to work as a Network Center Operator at a Start Up company called Ayesha Net. Coincidentally, when I was at the beginning of my stay in Lamongan in 2021, I also worked as a freelancer for network configuration/setup and maintenance in several locations such as homes, RT/RW Net, offices and schools. And one of my clients is Ayesha Net. The owner of Ayesha Net offered me a permanent work position but did it remotely because he didn't want to interfere with my main job at PT. Appnet
            Indonesia after I helped him freelance for approximately 1-2 years to build a network in his company so that it could be distributed to the surrounding area (Kec. Kedungpring, Lamongan) as RT/RW Net which at that time was starting from scratch (didn't have regular customers yet, only hotspot vouchers) until it reaches more than 50 customers. And now (2023) this company has more than 300 customers.</p>
